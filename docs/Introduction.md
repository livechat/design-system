Welcome to the LiveChat **Design System** – an open-source library of React components for building LiveChat products and applications. It was originally created to help our teams work faster together, but it can be easily adapted to create applications with the look and feel of LiveChat experience.

We created this **Design System** with several goals in mind:

- to document components, patterns, and design guidelines, all in one place,
- to ensure consistency in our code and design,
- to standardize the visual language and experience of LiveChat products and apps,
- to provide guidance on correct usage of the patterns,
- to streamline our design and development.

### How to use this?

We recommend that while building a new app, you begin by following the system as closely as possible to suit LiveChat brand and experience.

#### _Designers_

Every component in LiveChat **Design System** includes a documentation, code, and working examples (you can play with the component examples and see what happens). By downloading the _UI Kit_ (for Sketch) you have access to all of the components in addition to the code provided on the site.

#### _Developers_

Our **Design System** was created for React development, and it's available in the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livechat/design-system). If you are not working with React, then you can use our hosted [styles.css](https://cdn.livechat-static.com/design-system/styles.css) file to get look and feel of LiveChat app in your vanilla JS project.

### Who can use this?

LiveChat **Design System** is open for anyone who wants to use it! It's very much a living and evolving document — Check back often as we continue to iterate and evolve it.
