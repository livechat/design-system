# LiveChat Design System

React components and css styles library for use in Livechat products.
By creating a uniform system, we want to deliver a harmonious experience to our customers.
For someone whoâ€™s already used one of our products, the transition to another one would be smooth and intuitive.

## Installation

To install LiveChat Design System Components Library with npm, run the following command:

```
npm install --save @livechat/design-system
```

Libary has separate css file with components styles. You need to import it in your app as well. You can find it in `node-modules/@livechat/design-system/dist/design-system.css`. If you are using Less css preprocessor you can import design system styles directly in your styles main file:
`@import '~@livechat/design-system/dist/design-system.css';`
