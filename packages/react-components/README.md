This package contains a library of reusable React components designed to be used in various projects. These components are the building blocks of our design system and can be easily integrated into your applications.

## Installation

Run the following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or with you other favorite package manager, eg. [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)):

```
npm install @livechat/design-system-react-components @livechat/design-system-icons --save
```

## Basic usage

It is required to import the `CSS` directly into your project so it could be applied to components:

```js
import '@livechat/design-system-react-components/dist/design-system-react-components.css
```

You can import components directly from the npm package:

```jsx
import { Button } from '@livechat/design-system-react-components';
```

In case of icons there is a separate package (`@livechat/design-system-icons`) to be used in conjunction:

```jsx
import { Edit } from '@livechat/design-system-icons';
import { Icon } from '@livechat/design-system-react-components';

<Icon source={Edit} kind="primary" />;
```

## Documentation

At this stage of the project we consider Storybook and Figma as parts of our documentation ecosystem.

[Storybook](https://design.livechat.com/) - includes design system foundations, describes components API and allows to familiarize with the thier capabilities
[Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/2pFu80PXO5A2tfyrAGnx91/Product-Components) - it's not an official documentation from design perspective but we follow a simple rule of working in public

### Development

Required version of `node.js` is `20.14.0`.

If you're a [volta](https://volta.sh/) user, the project maintains node version entry within `package.json`.

You should start with installing dependencies:

```
npm install
```

After that just execute the `start` command. It will build all necessary packages in `watch` mode. `Storybook` should start automatically (if not - try visiting http://localhost:6006).

```
npm start
```

If `Storybook` is not enough, you can additionaly run `npm start:example` which will run `example-react` package in `watch` mode. `example-react` is a simple [React](https://reactjs.org/) app based on [vite-react boilterplate](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite). It has a direct dependency on `react-components` package, so every change should be reflected in the app via auto-reload.
