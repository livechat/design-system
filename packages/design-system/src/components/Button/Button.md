### Primary Button

Use when there is an action that is more important than any other actions and you need to draw attention to it. Don’t use more than one primary button per screen to avoid confusing users. Not every screen needs a primary button.
```js
<Button primary>Click me</Button>
```

### Basic Button

The standard button for most use cases. Only use another style if a button requires more or less visual attention.
```js
<Button>Click me</Button>
```

### Destructive Button

Use as a final confirmation for a destructive action such as deleting. These are found mostly in confirmation modals.
```js
<Button destructive>Click me</Button>
```

### Best practices
 - Prioritize most important action; don’t use more than 1 primary button per screen.
 - Position buttons in consistent locations in the UI.
 - Use short yet descriptive labels ({verb} + {noun}).
 - Use strong verbs to encourage action.
 - Avoid unnecessary words and articles such as the, an, or a.
