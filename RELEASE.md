# Release process of `design-system`

## Releasing package to `npm` registry

To deploy a package to the `npm` you need to be logged in as a `LiveChat` organization member. To confirm that you are logged in, you can use `npm whoami`. If you are not, use `npm login` and follow the instructions.

The deployment process consists of only single commandL `npm run deploy`. It will execute several sub-commands and you can run them separately if you wish, namely:

- `check` - fire up linter and unit tests that are provided per package
- `prettier` - format the code across the packages
- `predeploy` - clean up old dist files and build new ones.
- and finally deploy files to `npm`.

When deploying to `npm` you will have to decide how to version your changes. Currently we are on the verge of deploying first mayor version of `design-system` and because of that we use the pre-release convention: `1.0.0-alpha.xx` where `xx` is the revision of current build. After release we will follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

### Example

3 Confirm

### Disclamer
Keep in mind that a package won't be versioned if it has not changed. In the future a changed package will catch up with other packages in versioning. For example, assuming that version of package `react-components` is `1.0.0-alpha.17` but `icons` lag behind a bit and are at `1.0.0-alpha.15` because no changes has been made since two deploys. If you make some changes in `react-components` and in `icons` both packages will get `1.0.0-alpha.18` version.

## Updating documentation

On `Github` add the release with correct version and change-log.

- Tag is added automatically by [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna), remember to target `v1` branch.
- The name of the release is the name of the version/tag (eg. `v1.0.0-alpha.20`)
- First paragraph title can be set to `What's Changed`.
- In the change-log mention packages changed, link the pull requests and respective issues that are part of a release. Please follow the style used for previous releases (including author, PR, issue, and title info).
- As long as we work on a `alpha` version please select the `pre-release` checkbox.
